## Configuration

bubbleMonitor creates a config file at `~/.config/bubble-monitor/config.json` with sensible defaults. Tweak the refresh rate, history length, theme, or set custom alert thresholds for CPU, memory, disk, and temperature.

Want your own colors? Switch to the `custom` theme and define your palette:

```json
{
  "theme": "custom",
  "custom_theme": {
    "primary": "#7D56F4",
    "secondary": "#EE6FF8",
    "success": "#A1E3AD",
    "warning": "#F5A962",
    "alert": "#F25D94"
  }
}
```

## Platform Notes

Most features work everywhere, but there are a few quirks:

- **Linux**: Full support for everything, including GPU monitoring via NVML (NVIDIA) and AMD SMI.
- **macOS**: GPU info via `system_profiler`. Load averages show as "N/A".
- **Windows**: GPU name via `wmic`. Temperature monitoring might need admin privileges. Load averages aren't available.
